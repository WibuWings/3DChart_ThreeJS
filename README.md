# React Vite Project

This is a React project that uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a build tool.

## Features

- Fast and lightweight development server with hot module replacement (HMR)
- Optimized production build with code splitting and tree shaking
- Support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS modules, and other web technologies
- Built-in ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing
- GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment

## Getting Started

To run this project, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>

## Deployment

This project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

To deploy your app, you need to set the `homepage` field in the `package.json` file to your GitHub Pages URL, such as:

```json
"homepage": "https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>"
```

Then, push your code to the `main` branch. The GitHub Action will automatically build and deploy your app to GitHub Pages.

You can also customize the deployment script in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.
